This is a bootleg videogame. This means I'm doing it no profit, and I won't ever take 
any money from this work. Due to my economic limitations in the creation of this
videogame I took artistic works all across the internet, without paying for it.

I'm apologizing to everyone involved for not having asked permission. I strongly
encourage every player to support the artists' creations by buying them.
Here is a complete list of all the unlicensed content present in this videogame.

I sincere apologize to:

Sofia Karlberg / Avicii  for their song Lonely Together used in the introduction.

Buy her amazing songs!
